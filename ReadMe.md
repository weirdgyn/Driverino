# Driverino 

### (italian noun) /ˈdraɪvərnəʊ/ : *little driver*

Driverino is a pretty simple, low power, driver for [BLDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor) sensored motors.
The project target was to create a very small unit capable of driving a motor rated about 50-100W.
The board is fitted with ATmega32U4 micro the same of Arduino Micro Pro commercial boards, once the correct bootloader has been burned-in the board should act as an Arduino board (at least for programming/debugging task) and also spin a motor.
The project includes:
 1. Fully designed 2 layers PCB board (KiCAD);
 2. Driverino firmware sources;
 3. MCT8316Z library sources.

Driverino's firmware allow users to drive BLDC motors using a standard [RS232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232) interface trough simple interactive commands.
The firmware allows also:
* closed loop speed control (implementing a [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) loop);
* motor/driver status monitoring;
* R/C ESC emulation.

The library allows Arduino users to interact with BLDC motors without knowledge of MCT8316Z chip and [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) protocol.

## Driverino features

* ATmega32U4 microcontroller;
* Micro [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) interface;
* MCT8316Z motor driver;
* 41x26mm (size);
* RS232 interface;
* Standard R/C input compatibile.

The board can drive up to 24V-36V 8A rated sensored BLDC motors and provide 5V power supply (200mA max) mimicking R/C ESC BEC feature.
Driverino supports a variety of different types of [Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor)'s sensors (analog single ended, analog differtial, digital) and also different sensors supply rates (3.3V and 5V). To correctly fit for a specific sensor kind some soldering may be required: by default the board project is fitted for digital 5V sensors.
